The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, unexpected behavior can occur when using it with units that aren't compatible or when the calculation results in an invalid value. For instance, mixing percentages and pixels without proper consideration might lead to incorrect spacing or sizing. Another common issue is forgetting the spaces around the operators in `calc()`, which may lead to parsing errors and unexpected results.
